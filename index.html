    <!--HIGH SCHOOL -->
    <section class="question-answer-container">
    <div class="high-school">
     <div class="title"><h2>High School Experience</h2></div> 
      <div class="answers">
        <h3>
          How did you fare in high school mathematics, physical sciences and
          computing? Which were your strengths and which were most enjoyable?
          How did you rank, competitively, in these subjects?<br><br>
        </h3>
        <p class="scroll-text">To be honest, I have never been “good” at math. Unfortunately, most schools only cater to one or two types of learning, when there are five in total. Thus, leading me to be my own teacher and often reteaching myself school subjects. My lack of knowledge in mathematics never stopped me from trying, many times I would spend hours working in the library after school with a tutor, in order to fully get the subject down. Experiences like this, taught me that any subject can be dominated through consistency, hard work, and learning how to learn. Further, my continued learning of web development has taught me this. 
          <br><br>Although I have not been the best at math in the past, I currently excel in learning and logical thinking and problem solving. My strengths have always been my perseverance and setting goals. For example, throughout elementary school and middle school, I ranked low in math and English. However, when I entered highschool, I had a better understanding of how to learn and work hard. On account of this, I ended up enrolling in Advanced English, and AP English courses and, as well, signing up for statistics, which I fell in love with (obtaining high marks in all classes).
          Other enjoyable classes I took were Art and Public Speaking as both allowed me to be creative and share my creativity with others. <br><br>
          </p>
        <h3>At high school, what leadership roles did you take on?</h3><br>
        <p>I participated in school leadership role activities such as creating a float for a parade and riding around in it for the town. I also participated in a few funny presentations in front of the entire high-school. 
          <br><br>I was the type of person who always had thier eyes set on things outside my comfort zone such as doing a presentation in front of the entire school, picking classes that my friends weren’t in or trying out new sports even when I didn't know anyone or how to play. What made me a leader was my ability to not pay attention to what others thought but focus on what I found fascinating, insightful, and to do things that could make me grow. I did this by joining soccer and the track and field sport, participating in four different events: 100 meter, 200 meter, 4x4 relay, and the long jump.
          <br><br>In high school and throughout university,  I always played the leader when it came to group projects. I am all about organization, setting timelines, and understanding each other’s roles within the group. As a leader, I like for us to be open and cohesive, with set goals and times to get things done, with meetings in between to discuss where we are on the project.
          </p><br>
        <h3>
          What sort of high school student were you? Outside of required work,
          what were your interests and hobbies? What would your high school
          peers remember you for, if we asked them?
        </h3><br>
        <p>I have always been very diligent, even as a young child in elementary school. After school, I would work on my homework straight away so that I could play right afterwards. It was very difficult to enjoy myself knowing there were things I had to get done. 
          <br><br>I had an agenda in highschool where I wrote down all the assignments I had to do and when they were done and I would start working on them as soon as I got home. On account of this my friends always saw me as a studious and consistent individual and my school peers would describe me as studious, trustworthy, responsible with a dash of fun. 
          <br><br>Outside of school, I played sports. I played coed soccer, indoor soccer, and I played soccer for our high school team. I also dabbled in kick boxing and participated in school leadership activities.
          </p><br>
        <h3>Which degree and university did you choose, and why?</h3><br>
        <p>At first I chose communications / broadcasting because I enjoyed digging deep and getting to know individuals and the outside world and discussing topics in depth. Then I took my first sociology class and  fell in love with the topic because it allowed me to understand people, groups, and society on a deeper level than communications. I ended up expanding my studies and earned a Master in Social Science Quantitative Research at the University of Carlos III of Madrid. I loved the research aspect that this master offered and it allowed me to excel my writing </p>
        <h3><br>
          What did you achieve at university that you consider exceptional?
        </h3><br>
        <p>In the United States it is quite normal to work while studying at university. All throughout university I was studying full time and working at least one job, part-time. Throughout my university I was able to maintain a high gpa while working part-time and at times working two jobs while studying full time. Furthermore, I was on the Honor’s List, while in university, which signifies recognition for excellent marks, having a gpa above 3.5.</p>
