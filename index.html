     <div class="title"><h2>High School Experience</h2></div> 
      <div class="answers">
        <h3>
          How did you fare in high school mathematics, physical sciences and
          computing? Which were your strengths and which were most enjoyable?
          How did you rank, competitively, in these subjects?<br>
        </h3>
        <p class="scroll-text"> 
          <br>Although I do not have the best track record with math in elementrary school, I currently excel in learning, logical thinking, and problem solving. My strengths have always been my perseverance and setting goals. For example, throughout elementary school and middle school, I ranked low in Maths and English. However, when I entered highschool, I had a better understanding of how to learn and work hard. On account of this, I ended up enrolling in Advanced English, and AP English courses and, as well as, signing up for statistics, which I fell in love with (obtaining high marks in all classes). Then in university I had one of the highest marks in my English and Philosophy classes. My English teacher was so impressed with my work that he recommend me to tutor at the University. That ended up being my first job!<br><br>
          Other enjoyable classes I took were Art and Public Speaking as both allowed me to be creative and share my creativity with others. <br><br>
          </p>
        <h3>At high school, what leadership roles did you take on?</h3><br>
        <p>I participated in school leadership role activities such as creating a float for a parade and riding around in it for the town. I also participated in a few funny presentations in front of the entire high-school. 
          <br><br>I was the type of person who always had thier eyes set on things outside my comfort zone such as doing a presentation in front of the entire school, picking classes that my friends weren’t in or trying out new sports even when I didn't know anyone or how to play. What made me a leader was my ability to not pay attention to what others thought but focus on what I found fascinating, insightful, and to do things that could make me grow. I did this by joining soccer and the track and field sport, participating in four different events: 100 meter, 200 meter, 4x4 relay, and the long jump.
          <br><br>In high school and throughout university,  I always played the leader when it came to group projects. I am all about organization, setting timelines, and understanding each other’s roles within the group. As a leader, I like for us to be open and cohesive, with set goals and times to get things done, with meetings in between to discuss where we are on the project.
          </p><br>
        <h3>
          What sort of high school student were you? Outside of required work,
          what were your interests and hobbies? What would your high school
          peers remember you for, if we asked them?
        </h3><br>
        <p>I have always been very diligent, even as a young child in elementary school. After school, I would work on my homework straight away so that I could play right afterwards. It was very difficult to enjoy myself knowing there were things I had to get done. 
          <br><br>I had an agenda in highschool where I wrote down all the assignments I had to do and when they were done and I would start working on them as soon as I got home. On account of this my friends always saw me as a studious and consistent individual and my school peers would describe me as studious, trustworthy, responsible with a dash of fun. 
          <br><br>Outside of school, I played sports. I played coed soccer, indoor soccer, and I played soccer for our high school team. I also dabbled in kick boxing and participated in school leadership activities.
          </p><br>
        <h3>Which degree and university did you choose, and why?</h3><br>
        <p>At first I chose communications / broadcasting because I enjoyed digging deep and getting to know individuals and the outside world and discussing topics in depth. Then I took my first sociology class and  fell in love with the topic because it allowed me to understand people, groups, and society on a deeper level than communications. I ended up expanding my studies and earned a Master in Social Science Quantitative Research at the University of Carlos III of Madrid. I loved the research aspect that this master offered and it allowed me to excel my writing </p>
        <h3><br>
          What did you achieve at university that you consider exceptional?
        </h3><br>
        <p>In the United States it is quite normal to work while studying at university. All throughout university I was studying full time and working at least one job, part-time. Throughout my university I was able to maintain a high gpa while working part-time and at times working two jobs while studying full time. Furthermore, I was on the Honor’s List, while in university, which signifies recognition for excellent marks, having a gpa above 3.5.</p>

        <h3>
          Which libraries and frameworks do you think will succeed in Web development tool sets?
        </h3><br>
        <p>I would succeed in JavaScript, React.js, and debugging code. I am a very inquisitive individual who is very curious and investigative. I like to dive really deep into the subject and I look at web development as a puzzle. I have always been fascinated with how things work, taking things apart and putting them together. I have always been a person who loves building.</p>
        <h3><br>
          Describe your experience of web programming - JavaScript, Typescript, React, CSS and Python in particular.
        </h3><br>
        <p>I have created over 20+ projects with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I love HTML and CSS and I love how JavaScript can enhance your website to another level. After learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I went on to learn React.js, TailwindCSS, and CSS preprocessors such as SASS and LESS. I am currently advancing my knowledge on JavaScript backend on the server side. I am sharpening my skills working with Node.js, and Express. 
         <br><br> Typscript and Python are excellent coding languages that I have heard great things about. I cannot wait to start learning them and utilizing them in my side projects. I think it is best to have a solid foundation of JavaScript before moving on to a new language. Although, I have checked out Java and the syntax is similar to JavaScript. Thus, I have an inclination that once an individual is solid in one programming language the logic is the same for all others, it is only the syntax that needs to be learned.

          What are your thoughts on differences between utility based frameworks (such as Tailwind CSS) and component based (such as Bootstrap)

          Outline your thoughts on open source software development. Have you
          been an open source maintainer, and can you point to those projects?
        </h3><br>
        <p>Open source software is absolutely amazing! The fact that open source is open to everyone so that they can view, change, extend, or distribute it, is so fascinating. In my master program, we wrote many papers using open source data. We would download the data, clean the data, run regressions then interpret our findings. All this was done on Rstudio and Stata.</p><br>
         <p> I have several papers that I used using open source data. They are available upon request.

        <h3>What is your proudest success as an engineer, or leader?</h3><br>
        <p>My proudest moment as an engineer was when my bootcamp teacher asked me to teach at the coding bootcamp. He told me he saw potential in me and he admired the way I problem solved, always with a positive and inquisitive mindset. </p><br>
        <h3>
          Outline your views on the role of an engineering manager in shaping a
          high functioning team.
        </h3><br>
        <p>I do not take managing lightly. To be a conducive and successful manager, one must know that they are in service to their team. The engineering manager must be encouraging, dedicated, but most of all compassionate and empathetic. An engineering manager must have solid technical and soft skills. Soft skills such as: verbal and nonverbal communication, strategic thinking, feedback and criticism, leadership, emotional intelligence, and relationship skills.</p><br>
